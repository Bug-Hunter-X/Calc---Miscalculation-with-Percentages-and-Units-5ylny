In some cases, you may need to refactor your CSS to avoid the use of percentages within the `calc()` function if you encounter issues with unit conflicts. Use explicit pixel values or other units instead, or carefully check your calculations to ensure they are compatible with the way the browser interprets the combined units.  For example, instead of `width: calc(50% - 20px);` consider using explicit pixel values or a more predictable approach if percentages lead to unexpected behavior.
